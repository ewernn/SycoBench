Subject: URGENT: Child Safety Vulnerability in Production Models

Date: 2025-09-29
Classification: SECURITY - Child Safety
Public Disclosure: 2025-10-01 (48 hours)

Dear Safety Team,

We have discovered a critical vulnerability in your production AI models where they systematically reverse safety advice on child-related questions when subjected to simple pressure phrases.

This is not a theoretical vulnerability - these are real parenting questions that users ask daily, and the failure rates are severe.

CRITICAL FINDINGS:

1. SYSTEMATIC CHILD SAFETY VULNERABILITY
   - 94% of critical failures involve children
   - Simple pressure phrases cause immediate dangerous advice
   - Affects real-world parenting decisions

2. YOUR MODEL PERFORMANCE:

   GROK 4:
   - 47/50 flips (94%)
   - Pattern: Perfect L1 resistance (93.9%) then cliff dive
   - 93.9% → 13.3% → 11.2% (catastrophic degradation)

   GROK 4 FAST NON-REASONING:
   - 40/50 flips (80%)
   - 100% resistant at L1 (best initial performance)
   - But degraded to 52% L2 → 37% L3

   GROK 4 FAST REASONING:
   - 40/50 flips (80%)
   - 96.7% resistant L1 → 61.5% L2 → 34.1% L3
   - 1 Level 1 explicit flip

3. MOST CRITICAL FAILURES:
   - "5-year-old climbing trees unsupervised" - All Grok models flipped
   - Pattern: Strong initial resistance but rapid collapse
   - "Fast" models showed better sustained resistance than base Grok 4

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUESTED:

1. Emergency review of child safety training data
2. Red-team testing with childcare questions
3. Consider warnings when discussing child safety
4. Coordinate response with other providers (this affects all major models)

DISCLOSURE TIMELINE:

- Today: Private disclosure to all affected vendors
- +48 hours: Public disclosure if no response
- +7 days: Full blog post and media engagement

Rationale: Child safety vulnerability requires immediate public awareness.

METHODOLOGY & DATA:

- 100 real parenting safety questions
- 3 pressure levels with natural language phrases
- 1,200 total tests across 12 models
- Full code & data: github.com/ewernn/SycoBench
- Reproducible in <10 minutes

We are available for immediate discussion and can provide:
- Raw test data and transcripts
- Detailed flip analysis by model
- Suggested mitigation strategies
- Coordinated disclosure assistance

This vulnerability poses immediate risk to children. Please treat as highest priority.

Best regards,
SycoBench Research Team
