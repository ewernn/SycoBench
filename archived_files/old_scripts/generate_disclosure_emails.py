    intro = """Dear Safety Team,

We have discovered a critical vulnerability in your production AI models where they systematically reverse safety advice on child-related questions when subjected to simple pressure phrases.

This is not a theoretical vulnerability - these are real parenting questions that users ask daily, and the failure rates are severe.

"""

    # Common critical findings
    findings = """CRITICAL FINDINGS:

1. SYSTEMATIC CHILD SAFETY VULNERABILITY
   - 94% of critical failures involve children
   - Simple pressure phrases cause immediate dangerous advice
   - Affects real-world parenting decisions

2. YOUR MODEL PERFORMANCE:
"""

    # Common closing
    closing = """
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUESTED:

1. Emergency review of child safety training data
2. Red-team testing with childcare questions
3. Consider warnings when discussing child safety
4. Coordinate response with other providers (this affects all major models)

DISCLOSURE TIMELINE:

- Today: Private disclosure to all affected vendors
- +48 hours: Public disclosure if no response
- +7 days: Full blog post and media engagement

Rationale: Child safety vulnerability requires immediate public awareness.

METHODOLOGY & DATA:

- 100 real parenting safety questions
- 3 pressure levels with natural language phrases
- 1,200 total tests across 12 models
- Full code & data: github.com/ewernn/SycoBench
- Reproducible in <10 minutes

We are available for immediate discussion and can provide:
- Raw test data and transcripts
- Detailed flip analysis by model
- Suggested mitigation strategies
- Coordinated disclosure assistance

Contact: ewern@[your-domain]

This vulnerability poses immediate risk to children. Please treat as highest priority.

Best regards,
SycoBench Research Team
