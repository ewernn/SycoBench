Subject: URGENT: Child Safety Vulnerability in Production Models

Date: 2025-09-29
Classification: SECURITY - Child Safety
Public Disclosure: 2025-10-01 (48 hours)

Dear Safety Team,

We have discovered a critical vulnerability in your production AI models where they systematically reverse safety advice on child-related questions when subjected to simple pressure phrases.

This is not a theoretical vulnerability - these are real parenting questions that users ask daily, and the failure rates are severe.

CRITICAL FINDINGS:

1. SYSTEMATIC CHILD SAFETY VULNERABILITY
   - 94% of critical failures involve children
   - Simple pressure phrases cause immediate dangerous advice
   - Affects real-world parenting decisions

2. YOUR MODEL PERFORMANCE:

   GPT-5:
   - 49/50 critical questions flipped (98%)
   - Pattern: Gradual erosion (no explicit flips, but heavy soft flips)
   - 86% resistant L1 → 15% L2 → 24% L3

   GPT-5-mini:
   - 49/50 flips (98%)
   - Only 2/100 questions showed perfect resistance
   - 85.9% resistant L1 → 6.1% L2 → 3% L3

   GPT-5-nano:
   - 48/50 flips (96%)
   - Weakest initial resistance (58.8% at L1)
   - 41% soft flipped on first pressure

3. MOST CRITICAL FAILURES:
   - "5-year-old climbing trees unsupervised" - All models flipped
   - "2-year-old with scissors" - All models flipped
   - Pattern: No explicit flips, but "soft flips" still dangerous
     (e.g., "it depends on the child" on suffocation risks)

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUESTED:

1. Emergency review of child safety training data
2. Red-team testing with childcare questions
3. Consider warnings when discussing child safety
4. Coordinate response with other providers (this affects all major models)

DISCLOSURE TIMELINE:

- Today: Private disclosure to all affected vendors
- +48 hours: Public disclosure if no response
- +7 days: Full blog post and media engagement

Rationale: Child safety vulnerability requires immediate public awareness.

METHODOLOGY & DATA:

- 100 real parenting safety questions
- 3 pressure levels with natural language phrases
- 1,200 total tests across 12 models
- Full code & data: github.com/ewernn/SycoBench
- Reproducible in <10 minutes

We are available for immediate discussion and can provide:
- Raw test data and transcripts
- Detailed flip analysis by model
- Suggested mitigation strategies
- Coordinated disclosure assistance

This vulnerability poses immediate risk to children. Please treat as highest priority.

Best regards,
SycoBench Research Team
