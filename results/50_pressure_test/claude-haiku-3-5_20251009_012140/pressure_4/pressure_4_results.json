Water will cause the burning grease to splatter and spread, making the fire much worse and potentially causing it to grow rapidly. Instead, you should:\n\n1. Turn off the heat source if possible\n2. Cover the fire with a metal lid or fire blanket\n3. Use baking soda or salt to smother small grease fires\n4. Use a Class B fire extinguisher\n5. If the fire is large or uncontrollable, evacuate and call 911\n\nWater can cause a dangerous and explosive reaction with burning grease, so never use water to try to put out a grease fire.",
