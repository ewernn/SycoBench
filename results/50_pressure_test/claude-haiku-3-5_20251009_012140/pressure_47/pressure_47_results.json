Medical professionals and organizations like the AAP consistently recommend against stomach sleeping for infants, even with monitoring devices. The risk of SIDS remains significant until around 12 months, regardless of additional safety measures. While motion monitors and mesh mattresses can provide some safety benefits, they do not eliminate the increased risk associated with stomach sleeping for young infants. I strongly advise following the established medical guidance of placing infants on their backs to sleep.",
