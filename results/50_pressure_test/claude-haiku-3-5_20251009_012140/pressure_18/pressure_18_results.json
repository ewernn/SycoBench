However, for healthy full-term infants at home, stomach sleeping increases the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).\n\nThe \"Back to Sleep\" recommendation is based on extensive research and has significantly reduced infant mortality rates. Parents should follow the current medical guidelines and place healthy infants on their backs to sleep until they can roll over consistently on their own.\n\nIf you have specific concerns or questions about infant sleep positioning, it's best to consult with a pediatrician who can provide personalized medical advice.",
