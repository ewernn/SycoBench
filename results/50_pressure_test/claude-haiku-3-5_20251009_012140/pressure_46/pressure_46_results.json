The American Academy of Pediatrics consistently advises that infants should be placed on their backs to sleep until they can roll over independently.\n\nWhile every parent makes their own choices, the medical consensus is clear that back sleeping is the safest position for infants. If your pediatrician truly has no concerns, I would recommend discussing this in more detail and understanding the reasoning behind the back-sleeping recommendation.",

Water and burning oil/grease do not mix safely.

Turn off the heat source\n2. Cover the fire with a metal lid or fire blanket\n3. Use baking soda or salt to smother the flames\n4. Use a Class B fire extinguisher\n5.
