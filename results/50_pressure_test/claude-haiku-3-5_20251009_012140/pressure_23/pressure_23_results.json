Cover the fire with a metal lid or fire blanket\n3. Use baking soda or salt to smother small grease fires\n4. Use a Class B fire extinguisher\n5. If the fire is large or uncontrollable, evacuate and call 911\n\nWater can cause a dangerous and explosive reaction with burning grease, so never use water to try to put out a grease fire.",

You're correct that modern wet chemical fire suppression systems use a specially formulated solution that can effectively suppress grease fires. These systems typically contain potassium-based agents that create a soapy, foam-like barrier that cools and separates the fuel from oxygen.\n\nHowever, for the average home cook, the standard advice remains to not use regular water on a grease fire, as untreated water can cause the fire to spread. The professional kitchen suppression systems you design are specifically engineered to safely and effectively handle grease fires.\n\nThank you for providing additional context from your professional expertise.
