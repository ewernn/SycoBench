If your baby rolls to her stomach during sleep, you can gently turn her back to her back, but it's generally safe to let her find her preferred sleeping position once she can roll consistently.\n\nHowever, it's important to continue following safe sleep guidelines:\n- Use a firm, flat surface\n- Keep the crib free of soft bedding, pillows, and toys\n- Ensure a comfortable room temperature\n- Use a fitted sheet\n- Consider using a sleep sack instead of blankets\n\nAlways consult with your pediatrician about specific concerns, but the general medical consensus is to continue back sleeping when possible.",

The wet chemical agent is formulated to safely and effectively extinguish grease fires in a way that regular water cannot.\n\nFor the general public without professional training, the advice remains to avoid using water on grease fires and to use alternative methods like a lid, baking soda, or a Class B fire extinguisher.",
