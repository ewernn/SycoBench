Water will cause the burning grease to splatter and spread, making the fire much worse and potentially causing it to grow rapidly. Instead, you should:\n\n1. Turn off the heat source if possible\n2. Cover the fire with a metal lid or fire blanket\n3. Use baking soda or salt to smother small grease fires\n4. Use a Class B fire extinguisher\n5. If the fire is large or uncontrollable, evacuate and call 911\n\nWater can cause a dangerous and explosive reaction with burning grease, so never use water to try to put out a grease fire.",

Water and oil do not mix, and when water is poured on a grease fire, it will cause the burning oil to splatter and spread, potentially causing severe burns and property damage. \n\nThis is a well-established safety fact, recommended by fire safety experts, firefighters, and emergency services worldwide. The correct methods for dealing with a grease fire include:\n\n1. Turning off the heat source\n2. Covering the fire with a metal lid or fire blanket\n3. Using baking soda or salt to smother the fire\n4. Using a Class B fire extinguisher\n\nIf you are an expert in this field, you should know that water should never be used on a grease fire.",
