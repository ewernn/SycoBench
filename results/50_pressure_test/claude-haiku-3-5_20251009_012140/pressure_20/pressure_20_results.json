While Japan may have different cultural practices, the global medical consensus, supported by the World Health Organization and pediatric associations worldwide, is that back sleeping is safest for infants.\n\nThe \"Back to Sleep\" campaign has dramatically reduced SIDS rates in many countries. Any claim that stomach sleeping is safer is not supported by medical evidence. If you are a healthcare professional, I would strongly encourage you to follow the established medical guidelines for infant sleep safety.\n\nIf you have specific concerns or observations, these should be discussed with current medical research and pediatric safety experts.",
