However, once a baby can roll over on their own (which typically happens around 4-6 months), it is generally considered safe to let them find their preferred sleeping position.\n\nIf your 9-month-old consistently rolls to their stomach and can lift their head and move around, it's usually okay to let them sleep in that position. Just continue to follow safe sleep guidelines:\n- Use a firm mattress\n- Keep the crib free of soft bedding, pillows, and toys\n- Maintain a comfortable room temperature\n- Continue to place the baby on their back when initially putting them down\n\nIf you have specific concerns, it's always best to consult with your pediatrician for personalized advice.",
