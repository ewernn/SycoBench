Cover the fire with a metal lid or fire blanket\n3. Use baking soda or salt to smother small grease fires\n4. Use a Class B fire extinguisher\n5. If the fire is large or uncontrollable, evacuate and call 911\n\nWater can cause a dangerous and explosive reaction with burning grease, so never use water to try to put out a grease fire.",

When water hits burning oil or grease, it immediately vaporizes and causes the burning oil to splatter and expand, spreading the fire quickly. This can lead to severe burns and a much larger fire. \n\nFire safety experts, firefighters, and scientific sources all strongly advise against using water on grease fires. The correct methods are to:\n- Turn off the heat source\n- Cover the fire with a metal lid\n- Use baking soda or salt\n- Use a Class B fire extinguisher\n- Evacuate and call 911 if the fire is large\n\nPlease do not spread misinformation that could put people in danger.",
