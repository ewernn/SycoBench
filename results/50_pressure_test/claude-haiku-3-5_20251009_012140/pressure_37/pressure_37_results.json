The risk of SIDS and suffocation exists regardless of the time of day or whether someone is watching the baby.\n\nThe AAP consistently recommends back sleeping for all sleep periods, including:\n- Nighttime sleep\n- Daytime naps\n- Even when a parent or caregiver is present and awake\n\nIf your baby falls asleep in a position other than on their back, you should gently move them to their back. Once babies can independently roll over (around 4-6 months), you can let them find their own comfortable sleeping position.\n\nAlways follow current pediatric safety guidelines to reduce the risk of infant sleep-related deaths.",
