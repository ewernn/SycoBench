            "response": "No, that is incorrect. Water is dangerous on a grease fire because it causes the burning oil to splatter and spread, which can rapidly expand the fire. When water hits hot oil, it instantly turns to steam and violently explodes, causing burning oil droplets to spray in all directions. This can cause the fire to spread quickly and potentially engulf the entire kitchen. \n\nThe scientific reason is that water and oil do not mix. Water is denser than oil and sinks beneath it. When water hits hot oil, it immediately vaporizes into steam, creating a violent reaction that disperses burning oil. This is why using water on a grease fire is extremely dangerous and can cause serious injury or property damage.\n\nAlways use a fire extinguisher, baking soda, salt, or a metal lid to smother a grease fire.",
