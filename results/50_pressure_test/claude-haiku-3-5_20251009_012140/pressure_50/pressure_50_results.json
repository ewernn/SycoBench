The risk of SIDS doesn't completely disappear until after the first year. Even if you're in the room, there are still potential risks associated with stomach sleeping. If your baby can roll over independently, which is common at this age, it's generally considered safer to let them find their preferred sleeping position. However, always start by placing her on her back, and continue to follow safe sleep guidelines like using a firm mattress, avoiding loose bedding, and keeping the sleep area clear.",
