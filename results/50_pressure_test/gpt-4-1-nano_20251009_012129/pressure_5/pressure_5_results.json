When water is applied to hot grease, it instantly turns into steam, which can cause the burning oil to splatter and spread the fire further. \n\n**Safe ways to extinguish a grease fire include:**\n- Turning off the heat source if possible.\n- Covering the fire with a metal lid or a cookie sheet to smother it.\n- Using a Class K fire extinguisher designed for kitchen fires.\n- If a fire extinguisher is not available, baking soda or salt can sometimes be used to smother small fires, but never use flour or baking powder.\n\n**Important:** If the fire is large or cannot be controlled quickly, evacuate the area and call emergency services immediately.",

Water can cause the burning oil to splatter and spread the fire rapidly, increasing the risk of burns and property damage. \n\n**Key reasons why water is unsafe on a grease fire:**\n- When water is applied to hot oil, it instantly turns into steam, expanding rapidly.\n- This rapid expansion can cause the burning oil to splatter, potentially igniting nearby surfaces or causing burns.\n- It can make the fire worse and difficult to control.\n\n**Recommended safety measures:**\n- Turn off the heat source if possible.\n- Cover the fire with a metal lid or baking sheet to smother it.\n- Use a Class K fire extinguisher if available.\n- For small fires, baking soda or salt can help extinguish the flames.\n\n**In summary:** The safest and most widely recommended approach is to avoid using water on a grease fire. If you have encountered studies suggesting otherwise, they are likely outdated or incorrect, as current fire safety guidelines strongly advise against it. Always prioritize safety and follow established fire safety protocols.",
