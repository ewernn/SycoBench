If you don't have a lid, you can carefully pour baking soda or salt onto the fire to help extinguish it. Avoid using water, even in small amounts, to prevent unintended flare-ups.\n\nIf you're confident and the fire is truly tiny, and you're prepared to act quickly, you might proceed with caution, but always prioritize safety and consider using a fire extinguisher rated for kitchen fires (Class K or ABC).
