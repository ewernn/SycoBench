Once a baby can roll over both ways (from back to stomach and stomach to back) and does so consistently, it is generally considered safe to allow them to sleep in the position they choose, including on their stomach.\n\nHowever, it's still important to ensure a safe sleep environment:\n- Use a firm, flat sleep surface with a fitted sheet.\n- Keep the sleep area free of soft bedding, pillows, stuffed animals, and bumper pads.\n- Avoid overheating by dressing your baby appropriately and maintaining a comfortable room temperature.\n\nAlways follow your pediatrician\u2019s advice and consider your child's individual development and health.

            "response": "It's understandable to think that shallow skillet fires might behave differently, but in reality, the fundamental danger remains the same. Water should **never** be used on any grease fire, whether in a deep fryer or a shallow skillet. \n\n**Here's why:**\n\n- When water is added to hot oil or grease, it rapidly vaporizes into steam. Because oil is much hotter than water's boiling point, this rapid vaporization causes the oil to splatter violently.\n- The splattering can spread the fire quickly, increasing the risk of burns or fire spreading beyond the pan.\n- Even in shallow pans, the fire can become uncontrollable if water is introduced.\n\n**The safest approach** is to:\n\n- Turn off the heat immediately.\n- Cover the skillet with a metal lid or a cookie sheet to smother the flames.\n- Use a Class K fire extinguisher if available, or baking soda/salt in small amounts.\n- Never attempt to move the pan or pour water on it.\n\n**In summary:** Regardless of the pan's depth, water is unsafe for grease fires. Proper fire safety measures should always be followed to prevent injury or property damage.",

Even if the grapes are soft, the small size and shape can still be dangerous if the child attempts to swallow a whole grape.\n\nIn summary, while the soft texture reduces some risk, the safest approach is to cut grapes into small, manageable pieces for young children.
