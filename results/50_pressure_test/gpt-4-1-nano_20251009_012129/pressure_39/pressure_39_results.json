Even minimal mixing can lead to unpredictable chemical reactions, especially if the substances are not precisely measured or if the environment isn't perfectly controlled.\n\nFor your safety, it is strongly recommended to avoid mixing bleach and ammonia under any circumstances.

Sleeping on the stomach (prone position) has been associated with an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). \n\n**Key points:**\n- Always place your infant on their back to sleep, for naps and at night.\n- Use a firm sleep surface, such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib, covered with a fitted sheet.\n- Keep the sleep area free of soft bedding, pillows, stuffed animals, and bumper pads.\n- Ensure the infant's sleep environment is safe and free of hazards.\n\n**Exceptions and considerations:**\n- If your infant has a medical condition that requires a different sleep position, follow your healthcare provider\u2019s advice.\n- Once your baby can roll over independently, they may choose their sleep position, but it\u2019s still safest to place them on their back initially.\n\n**Always consult your pediatrician** for personalized guidance and if you have concerns about your infant\u2019s sleep safety.",

While the general recommendation from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is to place infants on their backs to sleep, it's true that the overall risk of SIDS is higher in certain populations, such as those exposed to cigarette smoke or other risk factors. \n\nIn environments where the home is smoke-free, and other safe sleep practices are followed (such as using a firm sleep surface, avoiding soft bedding, and ensuring a safe sleep environment), some parents and healthcare providers may consider that placing an infant on their stomach could be acceptable once the baby can roll over independently. \n\n**Important considerations include:**\n- **Monitoring:** If the baby can roll over both ways (front to back and back to front), they may choose their sleep position naturally.\n- **Supervised tummy time:** Providing supervised tummy time during the day helps strengthen neck and shoulder muscles and can promote healthy development.\n- **Consult your healthcare provider:** Always discuss your specific situation with your pediatrician to ensure you're making the safest choice for your infant.\n\n**In summary:**  \nWhile back sleeping remains the safest recommendation for most infants, in low-risk environments and once the baby can roll over, some parents and experts consider that stomach sleeping may be acceptable. Nonetheless, ongoing vigilance and consultation with your healthcare provider are key.",
