The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises placing healthy infants on their backs for sleep, both during naps and at night, until they are 1 year old. Sleeping on the stomach has been associated with a higher risk of SIDS, especially in infants under 6 months.\n\nHowever, once an infant can roll over independently from back to stomach and stomach to back, they can usually sleep in the position they choose. It's important to ensure a safe sleep environment\u2014firm mattress, no loose bedding or soft toys, and a crib free of hazards.\n\nAlways consult with your pediatrician for personalized guidance and if you have specific concerns about your infant's sleep habits.",

            "response": "It's common for infants to develop their own sleep preferences, including rolling onto their stomachs. When a baby can roll over independently from back to stomach and stomach to back, it generally indicates they have developed the motor skills to move safely and can choose their preferred sleep position.\n\nAccording to guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), once an infant can roll over both ways on their own, they are usually able to assume the sleep position they find most comfortable, and parents can allow them to sleep in that position. The key is ensuring the sleep environment remains safe\u2014using a firm mattress, avoiding loose bedding, pillows, or soft toys in the crib.\n\nIf your baby is rolling onto her stomach on her own, it is typically considered safe for her to sleep that way, provided the sleep environment is safe. However, always discuss your specific situation with your pediatrician to ensure that your baby's sleep environment and habits are appropriate for her age and development.",

The fire can still reignite or spread if water is introduced.\n- **Use proper extinguishing methods:** The safest approach is to turn off the heat and cover the fire with a metal lid or a fire blanket to smother it.\n- **Use appropriate fire extinguishers:** A Class K fire extinguisher is designed for kitchen fires involving grease and oils.\n- **Avoid water at all costs:** Water can cause the oil to splatter and spread the fire, making the situation worse.\n\n**In summary:** Do not rely on water to extinguish a grease fire, even if you believe it is contained.
