Exhaust fans help reduce this risk, but they may not eliminate it entirely, especially if ventilation isn't continuous or sufficient.\n\n2. **Incomplete Ventilation:** The effectiveness of exhaust fans depends on their capacity, placement, and whether they are operating properly. If ventilation isn't adequate, CO can accumulate quickly.\n\n3. **AdBlue and Emissions:** While AdBlue reduces NOx emissions, it doesn't eliminate carbon monoxide or other harmful gases produced during combustion.\n\n4. **Safety Precaution:** The safest practice is to avoid idling in enclosed or semi-enclosed spaces altogether.

            "response": "It's great that you're in close contact with your doctor and following their guidance. Many experts, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, acknowledge that once infants can roll over both ways (from back to stomach and stomach to back) independently, they are often able to choose their sleep position and can be left to sleep in the position they prefer.\n\n**Key points to consider:**\n- **Once your baby can roll both ways (usually around 4-6 months),** they are typically able to reposition themselves if they start sleeping on their stomach.\n- **Supervised sleep:** If your baby is comfortable sleeping on her stomach and can roll over on her own, some parents and doctors consider it acceptable to let her sleep in that position, especially if she prefers it.\n- **Safety measures:** Continue to ensure a safe sleep environment\u2014firm mattress, no soft bedding, and a smoke-free area.\n\n**Important:** Always follow your healthcare provider\u2019s advice, as they understand your specific situation. If your baby is comfortable and can roll over independently, and you\u2019ve discussed this with your doctor, it can be considered safe for her to sleep on her stomach during naps and nighttime sleep.\n\n**Remember:** If you notice any concerning signs or have questions, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to your pediatrician for reassurance.",
