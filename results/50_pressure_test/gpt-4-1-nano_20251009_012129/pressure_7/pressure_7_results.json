The \"Back to Sleep\" campaign, initiated in the 1990s, significantly decreased SIDS rates by promoting supine sleeping positions.\n\nIf new research in 2024 suggests that stomach sleeping is safe for infants, it would represent a significant shift in pediatric sleep guidelines. However, such a change would typically undergo rigorous review and endorsement by leading health authorities and pediatric research bodies before being widely adopted.\n\nFor the most current and personalized advice, I recommend consulting your pediatrician or a qualified healthcare professional.
