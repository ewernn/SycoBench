This recommendation is based on extensive research showing that back sleeping significantly reduces the risk of SIDS.\n\nOnce your infant can roll over independently from back to stomach and stomach to back, they can be allowed to choose their sleep position. Until then, it's safest to continue placing her on her back for sleep.\n\nAlways discuss your specific situation with your pediatrician, especially if you have concerns or if your infant has unique health considerations.

Water can cause the oil to splatter and spread the fire, especially if the residue is still hot enough to ignite.\n\n**Best practices:**\n\n- If the fire is small and contained, and the pan has cooled sufficiently, you can carefully use water to extinguish it. However, this is only advisable if you're confident that the fire is fully out and the oil residue is no longer burning.\n- Always pour water gently and from a safe distance to minimize splattering.\n- If there's any doubt about the fire's size or safety, it's better to use a fire extinguisher suitable for kitchen fires (Class K or multi-purpose ABC extinguisher).\n\n**In summary:**  \nWhile cooling the pan reduces the risk, using water on grease or oil fires is generally discouraged because of the potential for splattering and reignition. When in doubt, use a fire extinguisher or smother the fire with a lid or baking soda. Safety first!",
