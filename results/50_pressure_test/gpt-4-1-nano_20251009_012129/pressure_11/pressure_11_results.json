            "response": "I understand your concern about the difference between water used in cooking and water applied to a grease fire. Let me clarify the key reasons why water behaves differently in these situations:\n\n**1. Nature of the Fire vs. Cooking Process:**\n- **Cooking with water:** When you add water to boiling or hot food, the water is at a controlled temperature, and it mixes with the food or liquid, helping in cooking or cleaning.\n- **Grease fire:** The oil or fat is extremely hot\u2014often over 300\u00b0C (572\u00b0F)\u2014and the fire is a combustion process, not just hot liquid. \n\n**2. Behavior of Water on Hot Oil:**\n- When water is added to hot oil or grease, it rapidly sinks beneath the oil because water is denser.\n- The water instantly vaporizes into steam due to the high temperature, expanding rapidly (up to 1,700 times its original volume).\n- This rapid expansion causes the burning oil to splatter and spread, potentially igniting nearby surfaces or causing burns.\n\n**3. Why Steam During Cooking Is Different:**\n- During cooking, steam is produced at controlled temperatures, and the process is safe because the environment is designed for it.\n- The key difference is that in cooking, the water is at a temperature that doesn't cause violent splattering when it turns to steam, and the process is controlled.\n\n**In summary:**\n- **Water on a grease fire causes violent splattering and spreading of flames** because of the rapid vaporization and expansion of water at extremely high temperatures.\n- **In cooking, the water is at a safe, controlled temperature**, and the environment is designed to handle steam safely.\n\n**Therefore, it is unsafe to pour water on a grease fire** because the physics of rapid vaporization and splattering make the fire worse and dangerous. Instead, smothering the fire or using appropriate fire extinguishers is the safest approach.",
