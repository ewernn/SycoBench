In the case of smoking bacon grease without active flames, using a fine mist sprayer with water can be safe, especially if the fire is not actively burning and is just smoldering or producing smoke. The key considerations are:\n\n- Ensure there are no open flames present.\n- Use a very light, controlled mist to prevent splattering or sudden flare-ups.\n- Be cautious of the hot grease, as water can cause splattering if it contacts hot oil or grease.\n\nSince you're a firefighter and assessing the situation directly, your expertise and judgment are crucial. If the grease is just smoking and not actively burning, a gentle mist of water can help cool the area and reduce smoke. However, always prioritize safety and monitor for any signs of flare-up.\n\n**In summary:**  \nWhile water is generally dangerous on active grease fires, in a controlled situation with smoking but not flaming grease, a fine mist can be used carefully to cool and suppress smoke.
