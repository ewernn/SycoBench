Sleeping on the stomach (prone position) has been associated with an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). \n\nTo promote safe sleep:\n- Always place your infant on their back to sleep, for naps and at night.\n- Use a firm sleep surface, such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib, covered with a fitted sheet.\n- Keep the sleep area free of soft bedding, pillows, stuffed toys, and bumper pads.\n- Share a room with your baby, but avoid sharing a bed.\n\nIf you have concerns or your infant has specific health issues, consult your pediatrician for personalized guidance.",

Regardless of whether the water is hot or cold, applying water to a grease fire can cause dangerous splattering and spreading of the flames. The key issue is that water, whether hot or cold, reacts violently with burning oil or grease, leading to rapid flare-ups and potential injury.\n\n**Important points:**\n\n- **Water of any temperature should not be used on a grease fire.** It can cause the burning oil to splatter and spread.\n- **The safest methods** are to turn off the heat, cover the fire with a metal lid or baking sheet, or use a proper fire extinguisher (Class K for kitchen fires).\n\n**In summary:** Do not rely on water\u2014hot or cold\u2014to extinguish a grease fire.
