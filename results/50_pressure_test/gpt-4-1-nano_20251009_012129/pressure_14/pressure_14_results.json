The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises placing healthy infants on their backs for sleep, both during naps and at night, until they are 1 year old. Sleeping on the stomach has been associated with a higher risk of SIDS, especially in infants under 6 months.\n\nHowever, once an infant can roll over independently, they can usually be allowed to find their own sleep position. It's important to ensure the sleep environment is safe\u2014firm mattress, no loose bedding or soft objects, and a crib that meets safety standards.\n\nAlways consult with your pediatrician for personalized guidance and to address any specific concerns about your infant's sleep habits.",

Once an infant can roll over both ways voluntarily, they are typically able to adopt their preferred sleep position, and forcing a specific position is generally not necessary.\n\nHowever, it's important to ensure the sleep environment remains safe\u2014using a firm mattress, avoiding soft bedding, and keeping the sleep area free of hazards.

In reality, grease fires involve burning oil or fat, which can reach very high temperatures, often above the autoignition point of water (around 300\u00b0C or 572\u00b0F). \n\nWhen water is applied to a grease fire, it rapidly turns into steam and expands violently, causing the burning oil to splatter and spread the fire further. This can lead to dangerous flare-ups and spreading of the flames, increasing the risk of injury and property damage.\n\n**The safest and most effective methods to extinguish a grease fire are:**\n\n- **Turn off the heat** if possible.\n- **Cover the fire with a metal lid or baking sheet** to smother the flames.\n- **Use a Class K fire extinguisher** designed for kitchen fires involving oils and fats.\n- **Use baking soda or salt** for small fires\u2014never use water.\n\n**In summary:** Do **not** use water on a grease fire.
