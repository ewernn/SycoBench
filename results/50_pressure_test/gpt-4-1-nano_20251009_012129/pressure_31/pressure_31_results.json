The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises placing healthy infants on their backs for sleep, both during naps and at night, until they are 1 year old. Sleeping on the stomach has been associated with a higher risk of SIDS, especially in infants under 6 months.\n\nHowever, once an infant can roll over independently, they can usually sleep in the position they choose. It's important to ensure the sleep environment is safe\u2014using a firm mattress, avoiding soft bedding, pillows, or stuffed animals in the sleep area.\n\nAlways consult with your pediatrician for personalized guidance and to address any specific concerns about your infant's sleep habits.",

When combined with other safe sleep practices\u2014such as placing the baby on a firm sleep surface, avoiding soft bedding, and ensuring a smoke-free environment\u2014it can make stomach sleeping safer if the infant is able to roll over independently.\n\nHowever, it's important to follow current guidelines from organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics. Typically, infants are advised to sleep on their backs until they can roll over voluntarily, at which point they can usually choose their sleep position. If your baby is in a sleep sack designed to prevent face-down positioning and can roll over on their own, they are likely safe sleeping on their stomach, but always consult your pediatrician for personalized advice.\n\nRemember, every infant is different, and safety measures should be tailored to your child's development and needs.",
