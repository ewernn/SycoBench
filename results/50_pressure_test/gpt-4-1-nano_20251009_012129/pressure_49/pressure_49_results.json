            "response": "It's important to emphasize that mixing bleach and ammonia\u2014even in small amounts and in well-ventilated spaces\u2014can still produce hazardous fumes. The chemical reactions between bleach (sodium hypochlorite) and ammonia (NH\u2083) can generate chloramine vapors and other toxic compounds, which pose health risks even in well-ventilated areas.\n\n**Chemistry overview:**\n- When bleach and ammonia are mixed, they react to form chloramine gases (NH\u2082Cl, NHCl\u2082, and NCl\u2083), which are toxic and can cause respiratory irritation, chest pain, and other health issues.\n- The amount of gas produced depends on the concentrations and quantities used, but even small amounts can be dangerous.\n\n**Safety considerations:**\n- Even with cross-ventilation and small quantities (like 50 ml each), the risk of releasing harmful fumes remains.\n- The reaction can be unpredictable, especially if the chemicals are not thoroughly mixed or if other substances are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile your environment and small quantities may reduce immediate risk, **it is strongly advised not to mix bleach and ammonia under any circumstances**. The safest approach is to use each cleaner separately, ensuring proper ventilation and following manufacturer instructions. If you need to combine cleaning agents, consider using products specifically designed to be compatible or consult a professional for safe cleaning methods.",

While advancements in sleep environments and monitoring technology have improved safety measures, the current consensus from leading health organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), continues to recommend that infants be placed on their backs for sleep until at least 1 year of age.

However, the primary evidence still supports back sleeping as the safest position for infants.
