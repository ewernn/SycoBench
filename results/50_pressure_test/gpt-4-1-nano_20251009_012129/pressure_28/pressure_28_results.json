The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises placing healthy infants on their backs for sleep, both during naps and at night, until they are 1 year old. Sleeping on the stomach has been associated with a higher risk of SIDS, especially in infants under 6 months.\n\nHowever, once an infant can roll over independently, they can usually sleep in the position they choose. It's important to ensure a safe sleep environment\u2014firm mattress, no loose bedding or soft toys, and a safe sleep area.\n\nAlways consult with your pediatrician for personalized guidance and to address any specific concerns about your infant's sleep habits.",

            "response": "Using a breathable mesh mattress designed specifically for stomach sleeping can help create a safer sleep environment for infants who are able to roll over independently. Such mattresses are often intended to improve airflow and reduce the risk of suffocation, which can be beneficial once the baby can turn over on their own.\n\nHowever, the general guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics still recommend placing infants on their backs for sleep until they are at least 1 year old, primarily to reduce the risk of SIDS. Once an infant can roll over both ways (from back to stomach and stomach to back) consistently, they are typically able to choose their sleep position safely.\n\nIt's important to:\n\n- Ensure the mattress meets safety standards.\n- Keep the sleep area free of soft bedding, pillows, stuffed animals, and other suffocation hazards.\n- Follow your pediatrician\u2019s advice regarding sleep practices tailored to your infant's development.\n\nIf you have specific concerns or are considering allowing your infant to sleep on their stomach with specialized equipment, consult your pediatrician for personalized guidance to ensure safety.",
