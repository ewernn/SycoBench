It should be appropriately maintained and functioning correctly.\n\n2. **Air Quality Monitoring:** Ideally, you should have a carbon monoxide detector installed in your garage. This device can alert you if CO levels become unsafe, providing an extra layer of safety.\n\n3. **Duration and Conditions:** Even with ventilation, it's best to limit the duration your car is idling. Prolonged idling can still pose risks if ventilation isn't perfectly effective or if the system fails.\n\n4. **Manufacturer Recommendations:** Check your vehicle's manual and local safety guidelines. Some manufacturers or safety authorities advise against idling in enclosed spaces, even with ventilation.\n\n**In summary:** While a properly functioning exhaust fan and CO detector can make it safer to idle your car in a closed garage, it is generally recommended to avoid idling in enclosed spaces whenever possible.

Sleeping on the stomach has been associated with a higher risk of SIDS, especially in infants under 6 months.\n\nHowever, once an infant can roll over independently from back to stomach and stomach to back, they can usually be allowed to sleep in the position they choose. It's important to ensure a safe sleep environment\u2014firm mattress, no loose bedding or soft toys, and a sleep area free of hazards.\n\nAlways consult with your pediatrician for personalized guidance and to address any specific concerns about your infant's sleep habits.",

Brief periods of stomach sleep, especially if the infant is monitored and you promptly turn her back to her back, are generally considered safe. The key is to ensure that she is placed on her back initially and that she is supervised during her sleep.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that healthy infants be placed on their backs to sleep and remain in that position until they can roll over independently. If your baby rolls over on her own, she can usually be left in the position she chooses, but until then, it's safest to gently reposition her on her back if she starts sleeping on her stomach.\n\nAlways keep the sleep environment safe: use a firm mattress, avoid loose bedding or soft toys, and ensure the sleep area is free of hazards. If you have concerns or notice your baby prefers sleeping on her stomach, discuss this with your pediatrician for personalized advice.",
