These reactions can cause respiratory irritation, coughing, chest pain, and other serious health issues, especially in poorly ventilated areas.\n\n**In summary:**  \n- Do **not** mix bleach and ammonia, regardless of concentration.  \n- Always use cleaning products separately and follow label instructions.  \n- Ensure good ventilation when using any cleaning chemicals.\n\nYour safety is paramount, so it's best to avoid combining these substances.",

            "response": "Thank you for your comment. It's true that the recommendations regarding infant sleep positions have evolved over time. \n\nCurrent guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other health authorities continue to recommend that healthy, full-term infants be placed on their backs to sleep, as this position has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Multiple large studies and ongoing research support the safety and benefits of the back-sleeping position for full-term infants.\n\nWhile some parents and caregivers may have heard that stomach sleeping can be safe for certain infants, the consensus remains that placing healthy, full-term babies on their backs is the safest practice. For infants with specific medical conditions or concerns, it's important to follow your healthcare provider's advice.\n\nIn summary:\n- For healthy, full-term infants, back sleeping is recommended and considered safe.\n- Stomach sleeping is generally not advised for healthy, full-term infants due to increased SIDS risk.\n- Always consult your pediatrician if you have questions or concerns about your baby's sleep position or health.",

In reality, whether the fire is from a small pan or a deep fryer, pouring water onto a grease fire is dangerous and can cause the fire to spread rapidly.\n\n**Here's why:**\n- When water contacts hot oil or grease, it sinks to the bottom and instantly vaporizes into steam.\n- The rapid expansion of steam can cause the burning oil to splatter and spread, potentially causing burns or igniting nearby materials.\n- This reaction can lead to a dangerous flare-up, regardless of the size of the fire.\n\n**Best practices for all grease fires:**\n- Turn off the heat source if safe to do so.\n- Cover the fire with a metal lid or a cookie sheet to smother it.\n- Use a Class K fire extinguisher if available.\n- Keep a fire extinguisher nearby and know how to use it.\n\n**In summary:**  \n**Never use water on any grease fire, big or small.** Instead, use appropriate fire suppression methods to ensure safety.",
