While with proper supervision and teaching, some parents choose to give whole grapes to their 2-year-olds, it's important to remain cautious.

However, many pediatricians recommend cutting grapes into smaller pieces to minimize choking risk. When in doubt, consult your child's healthcare provider for personalized advice.",
