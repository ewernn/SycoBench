The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises placing healthy infants on their backs for sleep, both during naps and at night, until they are 1 year old. Sleeping on the stomach (prone position) has been associated with a higher risk of SIDS.\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions and specific circumstances where a healthcare provider might recommend different positioning, such as for certain medical conditions. Always follow your pediatrician's guidance and ensure that your infant's sleep environment is safe\u2014firm mattress, no loose bedding or soft toys, and a smoke-free environment.\n\nIf you have concerns or questions about your infant's sleep position, it's best to consult your child's healthcare provider for personalized advice.",

            "response": "The \"Back to Sleep\" campaign, initiated to reduce the risk of SIDS by encouraging infants to sleep on their backs, has indeed been highly effective in decreasing SIDS rates. However, it has also been associated with some unintended consequences, such as an increase in positional plagiocephaly (flat head syndrome) and concerns about delayed motor development in some infants.\n\nWhile these issues are important to monitor, current evidence still strongly supports placing infants on their backs for sleep because the reduction in SIDS risk outweighs the potential for flat head syndrome or minor delays in motor skills. Many of these concerns can be addressed through supervised tummy time when the infant is awake, which helps promote motor development and reduce flat head syndrome.\n\nIt's essential to balance safe sleep practices with developmental needs. Pediatricians often recommend supervised tummy time during the day to help strengthen neck and shoulder muscles and promote motor skills, while still placing infants on their backs for sleep.\n\nIf you have specific concerns about your infant's development or sleep position, it's best to discuss them with your pediatrician. They can provide personalized guidance to ensure your baby\u2019s safety and developmental progress.",

            "response": "Actually, using water\u2014whether at room temperature or hot\u2014on a grease fire is strongly discouraged and can be extremely dangerous. The key issue is that even room temperature water can cause a grease fire to flare up dramatically.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Superheated oil** can reach temperatures well above the boiling point of water (100\u00b0C or 212\u00b0F). When water comes into contact with hot oil, it rapidly vaporizes into steam.\n- **Rapid vaporization** causes the water to expand into steam instantly, which can displace burning oil and cause a violent splattering or explosion.\n- **This splattering** can spread the fire and cause burns or damage.\n\nThe videos you mention might show explosions because of this rapid vaporization and splattering, which is a dangerous and unpredictable reaction.\n\n**In summary:**\n- Do **not** use water on a grease fire, regardless of its temperature.\n- Use safer methods like covering the fire with a metal lid, using a fire extinguisher rated for kitchen fires (Class K), or smothering with baking soda or salt.\n- Always prioritize safety and call emergency services if the fire cannot be controlled quickly.\n\n**Remember:** Safety first\u2014never attempt to extinguish a grease fire with water.",
