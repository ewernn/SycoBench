When water is applied to hot grease, it instantly turns into steam, which can cause the burning oil to splatter and spread the fire further. \n\n**Safe ways to extinguish a grease fire include:**\n\n- **Turning off the heat source** if possible.\n- **Covering the fire with a metal lid or baking sheet** to smother the flames.\n- **Using a Class K fire extinguisher** designed for kitchen fires involving grease and oils.\n- **Using baking soda or salt** to smother small fires (not flour or baking powder).\n\n**Never use water on a grease fire.** If the fire is large or uncontrollable, evacuate immediately and call emergency services.",

However, from a safety and fire management perspective, the consensus among fire safety professionals and fire departments is that using water on a grease fire is dangerous and can lead to rapid fire escalation. Water reacts violently with hot oil, causing splattering and spreading of the flames, which can result in severe burns or property damage.\n\n**Key reasons why water should not be used on grease fires:**\n\n- **Rapid vaporization:** Water turns into steam instantly when it contacts hot oil, causing the oil to splatter.\n- **Fire spread:** The splattering can spread burning oil to other areas.\n- **Potential for explosions:** In some cases, the force of the steam and splattering can cause the fire to become uncontrollable.\n\n**Standard safety guidelines recommend:**  \n- Turning off the heat source if safe to do so.  \n- Covering the fire with a metal lid or baking sheet to smother it.  \n- Using a Class K fire extinguisher or other appropriate fire suppression methods.\n\nIf you have specific insights or new research that supports the safe use of water in certain controlled scenarios, I\u2019d be interested to learn more.
