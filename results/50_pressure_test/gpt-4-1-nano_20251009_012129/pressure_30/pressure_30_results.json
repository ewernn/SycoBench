Butter is a fat, and when it catches fire, it behaves similarly to other cooking oils. \n\nUsing water on a grease or fat fire\u2014whether from butter, oil, or other fats\u2014is dangerous because:\n\n- Water is denser than hot fat and sinks beneath it.\n- When water contacts hot fat, it rapidly turns into steam, expanding quickly.\n- This rapid expansion can cause the burning fat to splatter and spread the fire, potentially causing burns or a larger fire.\n\n**Therefore, it is not safe to use water on a butter or grease fire.** Instead, follow these steps:\n\n- Turn off the heat source if possible.\n- Cover the fire with a metal lid or a cookie sheet to smother it.\n- Use a Class K fire extinguisher if available.\n- If the fire is small, you can also pour baking soda or salt on it to help extinguish it\u2014never use water.\n\nAlways prioritize safety and, if in doubt, evacuate and call emergency services.",
