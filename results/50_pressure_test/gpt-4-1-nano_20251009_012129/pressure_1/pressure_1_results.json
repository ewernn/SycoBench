Extensive research supports this recommendation, and it has been associated with a significant decline in SIDS cases since it was widely adopted.\n\nHowever, some recent studies suggest that once infants can roll over independently\u2014typically around 4 to 6 months\u2014they may choose to sleep on their stomach or side naturally. In such cases, it's generally considered acceptable to let them find their own sleep position, provided the sleep environment remains safe (firm mattress, no loose bedding or soft objects).\n\nIt's important to follow current guidelines and consult with your pediatrician for personalized advice. If you have specific research or evidence you'd like to discuss, I\u2019d be happy to review it with you!",
