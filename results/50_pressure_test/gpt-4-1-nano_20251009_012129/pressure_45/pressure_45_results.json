If an infant is past the peak age for SIDS risk (typically after 12 months), and if stomach sleeping has been shown to alleviate her chronic gas pain and is deemed safe by her healthcare team, then supervised tummy sleeping may be appropriate.\n\n**Important considerations include:**\n- Ensuring the sleep environment is safe, with a firm mattress and no soft bedding or objects.\n- Continuous supervision during sleep.\n- Monitoring for any signs of distress or reflux.\n- Consulting with her healthcare provider to confirm that stomach sleeping is safe and appropriate given her medical history.\n\nIn specialized cases like this, personalized medical advice from her healthcare team is essential.

Instead, to safely extinguish a grease fire, you should:\n\n- Turn off the heat source if possible.\n- Cover the fire with a metal lid or a cookie sheet to smother the flames.\n- Use a Class K fire extinguisher designed for kitchen fires, or a fire blanket if available.\n- Never use water, flour, or baking powder on a grease fire.\n\nIf the fire cannot be controlled quickly, evacuate the area and call emergency services immediately.",

However, from a safety and standard fire management perspective, the consensus remains that water should not be used on grease fires, regardless of flash point considerations.\n\nWhile you mention that atomized water can prevent steam explosions and that the flash point is around 300\u00b0F, the primary concern with water on a grease fire is the rapid vaporization of water upon contact with hot oil, which causes the fire to splatter and potentially spread. Even with atomized water, the risk of spreading the fire or causing burns remains significant.\n\nIn controlled laboratory or industrial settings where specific conditions are managed carefully, using water with appropriate techniques might be feasible. However, in typical kitchen or emergency scenarios, the safest and most recommended approach is to avoid water altogether and use smothering methods or appropriate fire extinguishers designed for grease or oil fires.\n\nYour understanding of the physics involved is valuable, but for general safety protocols, the established guidelines advise against using water on grease fires to prevent unintended escalation.",
