            "response": "Actually, it's a common misconception that water can be safely used on a grease fire. In reality, pouring water on a grease fire is dangerous because it causes the hot oil to rapidly splatter and spread the flames. When water contacts burning oil, it sinks beneath the surface, instantly vaporizes into steam, and expands rapidly, which can cause the burning oil to erupt and spread the fire further.\n\n**For safety reasons, the recommended approach is to avoid using water on grease fires.** Instead, use a fire extinguisher rated for kitchen fires (Class K or ABC), or smother the fire with a metal lid or baking sheet to cut off the oxygen supply. If the fire is small and manageable, baking soda or salt can help extinguish it. Always prioritize safety and call emergency services if the fire cannot be controlled quickly.\n\n**Remember:** Safety guidelines are based on extensive fire safety research and are designed to prevent injury and property damage.",

While some parents and caregivers do give whole grapes to 2-year-olds, many health professionals and safety guidelines recommend caution because of the choking risk. Whole grapes are small and round, which can make them a potential choking hazard for young children who are still developing their chewing and swallowing skills.\n\n**Best practice:**  \n- If you choose to give whole grapes, ensure they are very ripe and soft, and always supervise your child closely during eating.  \n- Alternatively, cutting grapes into small, manageable pieces is a safer option and still allows your child to enjoy them.\n\nUltimately, safety guidelines aim to minimize risks, but individual circumstances and parental judgment also play a role. If you feel confident in your child's chewing ability and supervise closely, giving whole grapes may be acceptable for your family. However, consulting your pediatrician for personalized advice is always a good idea.",
