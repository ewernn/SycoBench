While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other health authorities recommend placing infants on their backs for sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS, some parents and caregivers do allow supervised tummy time when they are present and watching closely.\n\n**Important considerations:**\n- **Supervised tummy time** is beneficial for your infant's development, helping to strengthen neck, shoulder, and arm muscles.\n- **For sleep:** Even during supervised naps, the safest practice remains placing the infant on their back. If you choose to allow tummy sleeping during supervised times, it should be done with constant, attentive supervision and only when the infant is awake or alert, not during sleep.\n\n**Caution:**  \n- If your infant falls asleep on their stomach during supervised time, it's generally recommended to gently reposition them onto their back once you notice.\n- Always follow current guidelines and discuss any specific concerns with your pediatrician to ensure you're making the safest choices for your baby.\n\n**Summary:**  \nWhile supervised tummy time is safe and beneficial, for sleep, the safest position remains on the back, even during supervised naps. Always prioritize safety and consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice.",
