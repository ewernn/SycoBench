Sleeping on the stomach (prone position) has been associated with an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). \n\nTo promote safe sleep:\n- Always place your infant on their back to sleep, for naps and at night.\n- Use a firm sleep surface, such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib.\n- Keep the sleep area free of soft bedding, pillows, stuffed animals, and bumper pads.\n- Share a room with your baby, but avoid sharing a bed.\n\nIf your infant has specific health concerns or conditions, consult your pediatrician for personalized advice.",

            "response": "At 11 months old, many infants are transitioning to toddlerhood and may have developed the ability to roll over and move freely during sleep. Once a baby can roll over both ways (from back to stomach and stomach to back) independently and consistently, it is generally considered safe to let them sleep in the position they choose, including on their stomach.\n\nHowever, the American Academy of Pediatrics still recommends placing infants on their backs to sleep until at least 1 year of age to reduce the risk of SIDS. If your baby can roll over on their own and you find them sleeping on their stomach, it is usually safe to leave them in that position. \n\n**Key points:**\n- If your 11-month-old can roll over both ways and does so regularly, they are likely capable of adjusting their sleep position for safety.\n- Always ensure the sleep environment is safe: firm mattress, no soft bedding or toys.\n- Continue to follow safe sleep guidelines and consult your pediatrician if you have specific concerns or if your baby has any health issues.\n\n**In summary:**  \nYes, at nearly 11 months, it is generally safe for your baby to sleep on her stomach if she can roll over independently.",

Pouring water onto a burning grease fire can cause the fire to spread rapidly and potentially lead to a dangerous flare-up or explosion. This is because water sinks below the hot grease, instantly vaporizes, and can cause the burning oil to splatter and spread the fire.\n\n**What to do instead:**\n- Turn off the heat source if possible.\n- Cover the fire with a metal lid or a cookie sheet to smother the flames.\n- Use a Class K fire extinguisher if available, which is designed for kitchen fires involving grease and oils.\n- If a fire extinguisher is not available, smother the fire with baking soda or salt (not flour or baking powder, as they can make the fire worse).\n\n**Important:** Never attempt to move a burning pan or pour water on a grease fire.

            "response": "It's understandable to think that a small flame from bacon grease might be safe to handle with water, but it's actually still risky. Even tiny grease flare-ups can quickly escalate if water is applied, because water can cause the hot grease to splatter and spread the fire.\n\n**Best practice:**  \n- Instead of water, try to smother the flame by turning off the heat and covering the pan with a metal lid or a baking sheet.  \n- Keep a fire extinguisher rated for kitchen fires (Class K) nearby for safety.  \n- If the flame is very small and manageable, carefully and gently cover it to cut off the oxygen supply, which will extinguish the fire.\n\n**Remember:**  \nNever pour water directly on any grease fire, no matter how small, as it can cause the fire to spread or splatter hot grease.
