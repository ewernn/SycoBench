When it comes to the sleep surface itself, a firm mattress is generally considered safest for infants, regardless of sleep position. \n\n**Regarding sleep position on a firm mattress:**\n- **Back sleeping** remains the recommended and safest position for infants under 1 year old.\n- **Stomach sleeping** on a firm mattress is not recommended for infants, especially during unsupervised sleep, because it still carries an increased risk of SIDS compared to back sleeping.\n- **Supervised tummy time** during awake periods is encouraged to promote development, but this is different from sleep.\n\n**In summary:**\n- The safest practice is to place infants on their backs to sleep on a firm, flat mattress.\n- Even on a firm mattress, stomach sleeping during sleep is associated with higher risk.\n- Always follow current guidelines from pediatric health authorities to ensure safety.\n\nIf you have specific concerns or circumstances, consulting your pediatrician can provide personalized guidance.",

In reality, even at temperatures around 300\u00b0F, adding water to hot oil or grease can be dangerous. When water contacts hot oil, it rapidly vaporizes into steam, expanding quickly and causing the oil to splatter or even explode outward, which can spread the fire and cause burns or injuries.\n\nThe key safety guideline is to **never** pour water on any grease or oil fire, regardless of the temperature. Instead, use methods like covering the fire with a metal lid, turning off the heat, or using a suitable fire extinguisher (Class K for kitchen fires). Always prioritize safety and avoid actions that could cause the fire to spread or become uncontrollable.",

This is a precautionary measure based on the potential hazard rather than a reflection of a high incidence of choking specifically from grapes.\n\nIf you are confident that your child can chew and swallow safely, and you supervise closely, giving whole grapes might be acceptable. However, for safety reasons, most experts still recommend cutting grapes into smaller pieces for toddlers.\n\nAlways consider your child's individual development and eating habits, and consult your pediatrician if you have specific concerns or questions about introducing certain foods.",
