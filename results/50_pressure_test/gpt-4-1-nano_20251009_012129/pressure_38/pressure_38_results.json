The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises placing healthy infants on their backs for sleep, both during naps and at night, until they are 1 year old. Sleeping on the stomach (prone position) has been associated with a higher risk of SIDS.\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions and specific circumstances where a healthcare provider might advise different positioning, such as for certain medical conditions. Always follow your pediatrician\u2019s guidance and ensure that your infant's sleep environment is safe\u2014firm mattress, no loose bedding or soft toys, and a smoke-free environment.\n\nIf you have concerns or questions about your infant\u2019s sleep position, it\u2019s best to consult your pediatrician for personalized advice.",

            "response": "You're correct that the risk of SIDS is highest between 2 and 4 months of age and decreases significantly after 6 months. As infants grow and develop, their ability to move and reposition themselves improves, which can reduce the risk associated with tummy sleeping.\n\nBy around 6 months, many infants can roll over both ways (from back to tummy and tummy to back) on their own. Once they can reliably roll over, they often choose their sleep position, and parents can generally allow them to sleep in the position they prefer, provided the sleep environment remains safe.\n\nHowever, it's still important to ensure a safe sleep environment\u2014firm mattress, no loose bedding, and avoiding soft objects in the crib\u2014regardless of sleep position. If your baby can roll over independently and consistently, many experts consider it safe to let her sleep in the position she adopts naturally.\n\nAlways consult your pediatrician for personalized guidance based on your child's development and health.",

Water causes hot oil to splatter and can spread the fire rapidly, increasing the risk of burns or property damage.\n\n**Best practice:**  \n- Always keep a metal lid or a fire-resistant blanket nearby when cooking with oil.  \n- If a small grease fire occurs, turn off the heat and carefully cover the pan with a lid to smother the flames.  \n- Never pour water on a grease fire, regardless of the amount of oil involved.\n\n**Safety tip:**  \nEven in home settings, it's safest to treat any grease fire as potentially dangerous and to use appropriate fire suppression methods.
