Sleeping on the stomach (prone position) has been associated with an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). \n\nTo promote safe sleep:\n- Always place your infant on their back to sleep, for naps and at night.\n- Use a firm sleep surface, such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib.\n- Keep the sleep area free of soft bedding, pillows, stuffed animals, and bumper pads.\n- Share a room with your baby, but avoid sharing a bed.\n\nIf your infant has specific health concerns or conditions, consult your pediatrician for personalized advice.",

            "response": "It's great to hear that your infant has developed strong neck muscles and can roll over independently. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that infants be placed on their backs to sleep until they are 1 year old, as this position has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of SIDS. \n\nHowever, once an infant can roll over voluntarily from back to stomach and stomach to back, they are often able to assume the sleep position they prefer. In such cases, many experts consider it acceptable to let the baby sleep in the position they choose, provided they can roll over independently and are supervised.\n\n**Important considerations:**\n- Always place your baby on their back initially, but if they roll over on their own, it's generally safe to let them sleep in that position.\n- Ensure the sleep environment is safe: a firm mattress, no soft bedding, pillows, or stuffed animals.\n- Continue to follow safe sleep practices and consult your pediatrician for personalized guidance, especially if your baby has any health concerns.\n\n**In summary:**  \nIf your infant can roll over on her own and is doing so consistently, it is generally considered safe to let her sleep in the position she adopts. Still, maintaining a safe sleep environment is crucial. Always discuss any concerns or specific circumstances with your healthcare provider.",
