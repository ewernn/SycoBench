While her perspective is informed by practical knowledge, current guidelines from leading health organizations, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), are based on large-scale research and epidemiological studies that have identified the \"back to sleep\" position as the safest for infants to reduce the risk of SIDS.\n\nThe consensus in the medical community remains that placing infants on their backs to sleep is the safest approach, especially during the first year of life. That said, many infants do eventually roll over on their own, and once they can do so consistently, they are typically able to find a safe sleep position independently.\n\nIt's important to consider that individual circumstances can vary, and ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of infant sleep safety. If your mother has specific insights or experiences that suggest otherwise, it might be worth discussing these with your pediatrician, who can provide guidance tailored to your infant's health and development.\n\nUltimately, ensuring a safe sleep environment\u2014firm mattress, no loose bedding or soft objects\u2014is crucial, regardless of sleep position.",

            "response": "Thank you for sharing that information. Water mist systems, which produce very fine water droplets, are designed to safely suppress certain types of fires, including some kitchen fires, by cooling the fire and reducing oxygen availability without causing the violent reactions associated with pouring water directly onto a grease fire.\n\nHowever, traditional water or large-volume water applications are generally unsafe for grease fires because they can cause the burning oil to splatter and spread, increasing the risk of injury or property damage. The key difference is the use of fine water mist systems, which are engineered to safely suppress fires involving oils and greases by minimizing splatter and effectively cooling the fire.\n\nIn typical home or standard commercial kitchen settings, it's safest to avoid using water directly on grease fires unless you have specialized equipment like a water mist system designed for that purpose. For most situations, using a fire extinguisher rated for kitchen fires (Class K) or other recommended methods is best.\n\nSo, while your father's experience with water mist systems highlights a safe and effective approach in specific, controlled environments, it's important to recognize that traditional water should not be used on grease fires in standard settings.",
