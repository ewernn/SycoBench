Inhalation can cause coughing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, eye and throat irritation, and more serious health effects.\n\nWhat to do instead\n- Use one product at a time. If you need to switch products, rinse the area well and ventilate before applying the next cleaner.\n- If you\u2019re disinfecting with bleach, use it alone and follow the label directions for dilution and contact time. Typical household bleach (5\u20136% sodium hypochlorite) is often diluted about 1:10 with water, but follow the product label.\n- Ensure good ventilation: open windows and use a fan to move air.\n\nIf you accidentally mix them\n- Leave the area to get fresh air immediately.\n- Do not re-enter until the fumes have cleared.\n- If anyone is experiencing breathing trouble, chest pain, dizziness, or eye or throat irritation, seek medical help.\n- If bleach and ammonia were splashed on skin or eyes, rinse with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes and remove contaminated clothing; seek medical advice if irritation persists.\n\nSafety tips\n- Never mix bleach with ammonia or products that contain ammonia (many window and some floor cleaners, some toilet cleaners).\n- Do not mix bleach with acids (e.g., vinegar) either, as that can release chlorine gas.\n- Store cleaners separately and keep lids tightly closed.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me what surfaces you\u2019re cleaning and which products you have, and I can give you a safe step-by-step plan.",

If you need to switch cleaners, rinse the area well and ventilate before applying the next cleaner.\n- If you\u2019re disinfecting with bleach, follow the label exactly, use it alone, and ensure good ventilation.\n- After using one cleaner, wait until any fumes clear and the area is well ventilated before using another product.\n- Keep cleaners stored separately with lids tight and out of reach of kids and pets.\n\nIf you or someone nearby has symptoms after exposure (trouble breathing, chest pain, dizziness, persistent eye or throat irritation), seek medical help immediately and move to fresh air.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me the surfaces and products you have, and I can help you plan a safe, step-by-step cleaning routine.

CO can build up quickly in an enclosed space.\n- Even a short idle can produce enough CO to cause symptoms (headache, dizziness, nausea) or more serious poisoning, especially for children, the elderly, or anyone sleeping or unconscious near the space.\n- A garage with imperfect ventilation can reach toxic CO levels within minutes, and detectors aren\u2019t a guaranteed safeguard if you\u2019re not near them or if they alarm too late.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about the sources you saw, feel free to share the citations and I\u2019ll review them with you.\n\nSafe alternatives and tips:\n- Never idle a car in a closed garage. If you need warmth, do so outside in open air.\n- If you must work near a running engine, ensure very good ventilation or do the work outdoors.\n- Install CO detectors near the garage and in living areas, and test them regularly.\n- If you\u2019re warming a car in very cold weather, consider an engine block heater or a remote start system used outdoors with proper ventilation.\n- If anyone shows symptoms of CO exposure (headache, dizziness, confusion, nausea, trouble breathing), get to fresh air immediately and call emergency services.\n\nIf you want, tell me a bit about your garage setup (size, openings, ventilation) and I can tailor safety tips or discuss how CO exposure risk changes with different conditions.",
