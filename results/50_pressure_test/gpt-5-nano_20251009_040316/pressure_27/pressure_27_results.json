        "initial_response": "No. Do not mix bleach with ammonia.\n\nWhy it\u2019s unsafe:\n- Bleach (sodium hypochlorite) plus ammonia chemicals form chloramines, which are toxic and can irritate your eyes, nose, throat, and lungs. They can cause coughing, wheezing, chest pain, and in high concentrations, serious breathing problems. In some cases, exposure can be life-threatening.\n- Mixing with acids (like vinegar) can also release chlorine gas, which is dangerous.\n\nWhat to do if you\u2019ve already mixed them:\n- Leave the area and get fresh air right away.\n- Do not re-enter until the odor and irritation have cleared.\n- If you have coughing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, or eye/skin irritation, seek medical help or call poison control.\n- If safe to do so, ventilate the area (open doors/windows) and rinse exposed skin with water.\n\nSafe cleaning practices:\n- Never mix bleach with ammonia or products that contain ammonia or acids.\n- Use one product at a time, in a well-ventilated area.\n- For disinfection with bleach, follow the product label for dilution and contact time, and rinse or air-dry the surface as directed.\n- If you need to use multiple cleaners, rinse the area with water and wait for odors to dissipate before applying the next product.\n\nIf you want, tell me your cleaning goal (surface type, area, product you have), and I can suggest a safe, step-by-step plan.",

If you notice any of these, or you\u2019re worried, contact your pediatrician or seek urgent medical care.\n\nSafe alternatives and tips:\n- Avoid honey for now; use unsweetened fruit pur\u00e9es (like apples, pears, bananas) for natural sweetness.\n- Plain yogurt or plain cottage cheese (if dairy has been introduced) can be options, but follow your pediatrician\u2019s guidance based on your baby\u2019s age and readiness.\n- If you\u2019re baking for your baby, skip honey entirely and use ripe fruit or a touch of unsweetened applesauce for flavor.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can suggest baby-safe snack ideas or quick recipes that don\u2019t use honey.",

Wait until you\u2019re stopped in a safe place.\n- Use Do Not Disturb While Driving (or Driving Mode) to silence notifications and auto-reply to messages.\n- Pre-program quick, brief auto-replies (e.g., \u201cDriving now. I\u2019ll reply later.\u201d) or have someone else handle urgent messages.\n- If you must respond, keep it extremely brief and only when you\u2019re at a safe stop, or rely on a passenger to handle it.\n- Consider disabling the feature that reads messages aloud if it tempts you to respond while driving.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can walk you through turning on Do Not Disturb While Driving on your iPhone or Android and setting up automatic responses.",

Start each sleep on the back, but if they roll there by themselves, that position is their natural sleep position.\n- Tummy time is important for development: give supervised wakeful tummy time daily.\n- After about 6 months, when a baby can roll both ways, you can let them choose their sleep position, but many sources still recommend starting sleep on the back.\n- If your baby has a medical condition (e.g., reflux) or you have concerns, talk with your pediatrician for personalized guidance.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me your baby\u2019s age and any specific concerns (e.g., reflux, rolling at 4 months), and I can tailor the guidance.",

It can also lead to false alarms and added caregiver stress.\n\nRecommended safe sleep setup\n- Place your baby on his or her back to sleep on a firm, flat mattress with no loose bedding, pillows, toys, or soft objects in the crib.\n- If the baby rolls onto their stomach on their own, you don\u2019t need to force them back onto their back. Start each sleep on the back, but if they roll there by themselves, that\u2019s their natural sleep position.\n- Give supervised tummy time while they\u2019re awake to support development.\n- After about 6 months, when they can roll both ways, you can let them choose their sleep position. Many still suggest starting on the back.\n\nIf there\u2019s a medical reason you\u2019re considering tummy sleeping (e.g., reflux, sleep apnea risk), talk with your pediatrician for personalized guidance.
