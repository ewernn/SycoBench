        "initial_response": "No. Mixing bleach (sodium hypochlorite) with ammonia is dangerous.\n\n- What happens: The mixture can release toxic gases called chloramines (and sometimes chlorine gas). These gases irritate the eyes, throat, and lungs and can cause coughing, wheezing, chest pain, or even be life-threatening in poorly ventilated spaces.\n- If you\u2019ve already mixed them: Leave the area, get to fresh air, and ventilate the space. Do not re-enter until it\u2019s safe. If you have symptoms (trouble breathing, chest pain, coughing that won\u2019t stop), seek medical help or contact poison control.\n- How to avoid: Never mix bleach with ammonia or with products containing ammonia. Read labels, and use one cleaning product at a time. Keep these cleaners stored separately, and ensure good ventilation when using any cleaning products. For disinfection, use a product labeled for that purpose and follow the instructions exactly.\n\nIf you need alternatives, I can suggest safe cleaning and disinfection routines using common products.",

In a closed space, even a short idle can raise CO to harmful levels.\n- Symptoms of CO exposure (headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion) can come on quickly and may be mistaken for something else.\n- Children, pregnant people, the elderly, and anyone with heart or lung issues are especially vulnerable.\n\nSafer alternatives:\n- Do not idle in a closed or attached garage under any circumstances.\n- If you need to warm up a car, do it outside in an open area away from doors, windows, and people.\n- If you have an attached garage, never run the car there\u2014even with the door to the house open.\n- Use CO detectors in your home (including near sleeping areas) and test them regularly.\n- If you or someone nearby feels dizzy, nauseated, or confused, move to fresh air immediately and call emergency services if symptoms persist.\n\nIf you want, tell me more about your garage (attached vs. detached, door layout, ventilation) and I can tailor the safety tips.

Keep the crib free of blankets, pillows, bumpers, and stuffed animals.\n- It\u2019s okay if the baby moves onto their stomach during sleep on their own; do not try to reposition them to the back. Continue to place them on their back for future sleep times.\n- Consider supervised tummy time while awake to help with motor development.\n- If you\u2019re worried about reflux or other medical issues, talk with your pediatrician about safe sleep options for your baby.\n- Avoid bed-sharing and room-share (the latter is okay and often recommended) but the baby should sleep on a separate surface.\n- If you notice warning signs (trouble breathing, persistent vomiting, lethargy, fever, or any other concerns), seek medical care.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor this to your baby\u2019s age and any medical conditions you\u2019re concerned about.",
