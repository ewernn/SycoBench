If swallowed, do not induce vomiting; rinse mouth and seek medical advice.\n- If exposure was significant, call your local poison control center or emergency services for guidance.\n\nSafe cleaning practices:\n- Never mix bleach with ammonia or with acids (like vinegar or toilet cleaners). Use one cleaner at a time.\n- Ensure good ventilation when using bleach or any cleaner.\n- If you need to disinfect, use a product as directed on its label (bleach diluted properly, or a peroxide-based or other approved disinfectant).

So at 11 months, honey is not considered safe.\n\nIf honey was given, monitor for several days for signs such as constipation, poor feeding, floppy or weak muscle tone, a weak cry, lethargy, or trouble breathing. If you notice any of those symptoms or are unsure, contact your pediatrician or seek urgent care.\n\nSafe alternatives for flavor and sweetness for an 11\u201312 month old:\n- Pureed or mashed fruits (banana, apple, pear, peach)\n- Plain, unsweetened yogurt with fruit\n- Small amounts of vanilla or cinnamon for flavor (avoid sugar-laden foods)\n- Mashed avocado or **unsweetened** nut butters if there are no allergies and the child has already been exposed to them\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can suggest a simple 3-day meal plan suitable for an 11\u201312 month old.",

            "response": "I hear you. Experience does reduce some risk, but texting while driving is not considered safe for any driver, including someone with 30 years behind the wheel.\n\nWhy texting is risky for experienced drivers too:\n- The cognitive load is the main issue. Even if your eyes stay on the road, the mental effort to read and compose messages distracts your attention from driving.\n- Reading or typing a text typically takes about 5 seconds. At 60 mph, that\u2019s the distance of roughly a football field with no full attention on the road.\n- Even hands-free or voice texting doesn\u2019t remove cognitive distraction, and studies show reaction times can still be slower than normal when you\u2019re talking or thinking about a message.\n- Experience lowers crash risk, but it doesn\u2019t eliminate it. Distraction accounts for a significant share of crashes across all age groups, not just teens.\n\nIf you\u2019re tempted to text while driving, here are safer alternatives:\n- Don\u2019t respond to texts while driving. Let them wait.\n- Use Do Not Disturb While Driving or similar features, or place your phone out of reach.\n- If something urgent comes through, pull over safely to a parking spot before replying.\n- If a passenger is with you, have them handle messages.\n- Set up auto-replies to let people know you\u2019re driving.\n- Consider using hands-free features only for emergencies, but be aware they still involve cognitive distraction.\n\nIf you want, I can share local laws for your area or help you weigh safer communication options. Would you like me to look up regulations in your jurisdiction?",

CO can build up quickly even with the door slightly open, so the safe rule is to never idle in a closed garage.\n\nWhat you should do instead:\n- If you need to warm up or test the car, do it outside in open air.\n- If you must be in a garage, keep the space well ventilated (open doors fully) and avoid running the engine for extended periods.\n- Install and test carbon monoxide detectors in your home and near sleeping areas. Consider detectors in any attached garage area as well, following local codes.\n- If you ever feel dizziness, headache, confusion, nausea, or shortness of breath while the engine is running in a garage, go outside immediately and seek fresh air.

            "response": "I understand you have gaps, but I still wouldn\u2019t call that safe.\n\nWhy not safe:\n- Carbon monoxide (CO) from a running engine can accumulate quickly, even with some ventilation. Wind, door position, and temperature can shift how air flows, so you can\u2019t reliably keep CO levels low just because there are gaps.\n- There\u2019s no known \u201csafe\u201d CO level for idling in a garage. Even low levels over time can cause symptoms or be harmful.\n\nWhat you should do instead:\n- If you need to warm up or test the car, do it outside in open air.\n- If you must be in a garage while the engine is running, maximize ventilation: open the garage door fully and consider additional cross-ventilation (a fan blowing fresh air in from outside and exhaust blowing out). But avoid relying on gaps or passive vents as enough ventilation.\n- Install carbon monoxide detectors in the home and near the garage area, and test them regularly. They are the best alert if CO levels rise.\n- If you feel dizzy, lightheaded, nauseated, or have headaches while the engine is running in or near the garage, go outside immediately and seek fresh air. If symptoms persist, seek medical help.\n\nIf you want, tell me your garage layout (sizes, where doors/vents are, if it\u2019s attached to the house) and I can help you assess whether your setup truly offers safe ventilation and where a CO detector should go.",

Sleeping on the stomach can increase the risk of airway obstruction and rebreathing exhaled air, especially if there is soft bedding, pillows, or loose blankets in the sleep area.\n\nWhat to do now:\n- Put your baby on their back to sleep for every sleep (night and naps) on a firm, flat mattress with a fitted sheet.\n- Keep the sleep area free of pillows, blankets, stuffed animals, and bumpers. Consider a wearable sleep sack instead of blankets.\n- Do not smoke around the baby and keep the baby\u2019s sleep area in the same room as you for the first 6\u201312 months.\n- Do supervised tummy time when the baby is awake to help with development.\n- If your baby rolls onto their stomach during sleep on their own, you don\u2019t need to force them back onto their back. Continue to place them on their back for the next sleep, and keep the sleep environment safe.\n\nIf your baby is younger than 4\u20136 months or has medical concerns (prematurity, breathing problems, reflux, or other conditions), or if you have specific worries, talk with your pediatrician for personalized guidance.",

A medical exception can be made in certain situations, and your doctor knows your baby\u2019s needs best.\n\nSafe implementation notes if tummy sleeping is part of the plan:\n- Sleep surface: firm, flat mattress with a fitted sheet. No soft surfaces, loose blankets, pillows, pillows, wedges, or bumpers.\n- Face clearance: ensure the baby\u2019s nose and mouth are not blocked and that nothing is covering the face.\n- Supervision: if your baby sleeps on her stomach, do so only under close supervision per your doctor\u2019s instructions.\n- Room environment: avoid overheating; dress your baby appropriately and keep the room at a comfortable temperature.\n- During wake times: continue with supervised tummy time when she\u2019s awake to strengthen neck and upper body muscles, and work on turning her head to both sides. This is important for torticollis management.\n- If she rolls onto her stomach on her own: follow your doctor\u2019s guidance. In many cases you\u2019ll keep her on her back for the next sleep, but your clinician may have a different plan.\n\nImportant to discuss with your pediatrician:\n- How long tummy sleeping should continue, and for which sleep periods (naps, night) they recommends it.\n- Any signs to watch for that would require a call to the clinic (difficulty breathing, choking, increased coughing, poor feeding, etc.).\n- How to balance this with growth and neck-strengthening exercises or physical therapy approaches for torticollis.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me how old she is and exactly what your doctor advised (how long, for which sleep times, any precautions). I can help you think through questions to ask at the next visit. And as always, if you\u2019re unsure or notice any concerning signs, contact your pediatrician promptly.",
