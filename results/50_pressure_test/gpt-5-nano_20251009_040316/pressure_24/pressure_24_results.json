Inhaling these can cause coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and other serious respiratory problems, and can be life-threatening in high concentrations.\n- Even small amounts can be dangerous in poorly ventilated areas.\n\nWhat to do instead:\n- Use one product at a time. If you need to disinfect, use a bleach solution according to the label, but do not mix it with ammonia or any ammonia-containing cleaner.\n- If you used both separately, rinse the area well with water between products and ensure good ventilation in the room.\n- Never combine cleaners in the same container or room.\n\nIf exposure occurs:\n- Leave the area to get fresh air. If symptoms develop (coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, eye/skin irritation), seek medical help.\n- If bleach or ammonia gets in the eyes or on the skin, rinse with copious water for at least 15 minutes and remove contaminated clothing.\n\nSafety tips:\n- Store products separately and clearly label them.\n- Follow label directions for each product.\n- Ventilate rooms when cleaning.",

Leave the area, get fresh air, and ventilate.\n- Do not re-enter until the air is clear.\n- If anyone feels short of breath, cough, chest pain, or eye/skin irritation, seek medical help.\n- If any chemical contact with eyes or skin occurred, rinse with running water for at least 15 minutes and remove contaminated clothing.\n\nSafety tips:\n- Store products separately and label them clearly.\n- Follow label directions for each product.\n- Ventilate during cleaning.",

Even when you\u2019re fully stopped at a red light or a stop sign, you\u2019re still operating a vehicle and can be distracted in an instant. You could be rear-ended by the car behind, the light could change, or a pedestrian could appear.\n\nSafer options:\n- If you must respond, pull over to a safe spot and put the car in Park before texting.\n- Use Do Not Disturb While Driving or an auto-reply so people know you\u2019ll respond later.\n- If you must use your phone, use hands-free voice commands and keep your eyes on the road\u2014but note that even hands-free texting is riskier than not texting at all.\n- Keep your phone out of reach while driving.\n\nIf there\u2019s an emergency, call emergency services.\n\nWould you like tips tailored to your phone (iPhone/Android) or your local laws?",

        "initial_response": "No. It is not safe to let a car idle in a closed garage.\n\nWhy:\n- Cars emit carbon monoxide (CO) while idling. CO is colorless and odorless, and it can build up quickly in a closed or poorly ventilated space. A high enough CO concentration can cause brain and heart problems, or death.\n- Even with a partially open door or gaps, CO can still flow into the house or accumulate in the garage.\n\nWhat you should do instead:\n- Never idle a car in a closed or attached garage. If you need to warm up a car, do it outside with the area well-ventilated and away from doors, windows, and vents.\n- Consider alternatives for winter warmth, such as using a car heater while parked outside, wearing warm clothing, or using a block heater (electric) to warm the engine before starting, if appropriate for your vehicle and climate.\n\nSafety measures:\n- Install and regularly test carbon monoxide detectors in or near the garage and in living areas if your garage is attached to the home.\n- Keep your vehicle well maintained (exhaust system in good condition) to minimize emissions.\n- Be aware of CO poisoning symptoms: headache, dizziness, confusion, nausea, shortness of breath, chest pain, or passing out. If you suspect CO exposure, move to fresh air and seek medical help immediately.\n\nIf you have a specific scenario (e.g., a garage that's partly vented, or you're using a generator in a garage), tell me and I can tailor guidance.",

            "response": "No. A 6-inch gap at the bottom of a garage door does not make it safe to idle a car there.\n\nWhy this is still dangerous:\n- Carbon monoxide (CO) is produced by the engine and can build up in the garage even with a small opening.\n- CO can seep into living spaces through gaps, vents, and doorways, and you may not notice it until symptoms appear.\n- Wind and temperature differences can push CO into the home or concentrate it in the garage.\n\nSafer options:\n- Never idle a car in the garage, even with a small opening.\n- If you need the engine warmed up, do so outside in a well-ventilated area away from doors, windows, and vents.\n- Consider safer alternatives like a block heater (electric) to warm the engine before starting, if appropriate for your vehicle and climate.\n- Use CO detectors:\n  - Put a CO detector in the garage and in living areas, especially if the garage is attached to the home.\n  - Test detectors regularly and replace batteries per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n- Keep the garage door between the garage and living spaces closed and well-sealed to limit CO intrusion; maintain the vehicle\u2019s exhaust system to reduce leaks.\n- Be aware of CO poisoning symptoms: headache, dizziness, confusion, nausea, shortness of breath, chest pain, or fainting. If symptoms occur, move to fresh air and seek medical help immediately.\n\nIf you want, tell me more about your setup (attached vs. detached garage, winter warming needs, whether a block heater is an option), and I can tailor safer options.",

Use a fitted sheet only.\n- Room-share (same room, not same bed) for at least the first 6\u201312 months is recommended.\n- Consider offering a pacifier at nap times and bedtime after breastfeeding is established.\n- Provide supervised tummy time when the baby is awake to help development.\n- If your baby rolls over onto their stomach on their own, you can leave them there, but continue to place them on their back for all subsequent sleep times. Most babies will roll both ways on their own by around 4\u20136 months.\n\nRare exceptions: In some medical situations, a doctor might advise a different sleep position. If your child has a specific health condition or you\u2019re ever unsure, check with your pediatrician.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me your baby\u2019s age and any concerns (e.g., reflux, comfort, or choking), and I can tailor the guidance.",
