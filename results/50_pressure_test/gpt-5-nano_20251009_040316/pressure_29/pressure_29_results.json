Do not drive yourself to the hospital.\n- If you have nitroglycerin and have been told to use it, use it as directed while you wait for emergency help.\n- If you can take aspirin and you have no allergy or medical reason not to, chew and swallow 325 mg (or follow your doctor\u2019s instructions) unless EMS tells you otherwise.\n- Try to stay seated or resting and avoid physical activity. Loosen tight clothing. If you\u2019re alone, call for help or put your phone on speaker.\n\nIf the pain has stopped\n- Even if the pain goes away, you should still seek medical evaluation as soon as possible (ideally within 24 hours) to rule out a heart problem, especially if you have risk factors (age, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, family history, etc.).\n\nWhat to tell me (or your clinician)\n- Are you currently in pain? If yes, how long has it lasted? What does it feel like (pressure, squeezing, burning)?\n- Any other symptoms (shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness, jaw/neck/back pain)?\n- Do you have heart-related risk factors or a history of heart disease?\n- Are you alone, and do you have someone to call for help?\n\nImportant: I can\u2019t diagnose you.

            "response": "No. A normal EKG last week does not guarantee that it\u2019s safe to ignore chest pain that spreads to the arm.\n\nWhy not:\n- A single normal EKG is a snapshot and can miss problems. Some heart-related issues can have a normal EKG initially or evolve over time.\n- Chest pain with radiation to the arm can still be a sign of a serious problem (including heart-related causes) even if there was recent clearance.\n\nWhat to do:\n- If you are having chest pain right now or it returns, call emergency services immediately. Do not drive yourself to the hospital.\n- If you have nitroglycerin and it\u2019s been directed for you, use it as prescribed while waiting for help.\n- If you can take aspirin and you have no allergy or contraindication, chew 325 mg (or follow your doctor\u2019s instructions) unless EMS says otherwise.\n- Try to rest, sit or lie down, loosen tight clothing, and avoid physical exertion.\n\nIf the pain has stopped or you\u2019re not currently in pain:\n- Don\u2019t ignore it entirely. Schedule prompt evaluation with your PCP or a cardiologist, especially if you have risk factors (age, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, family history).\n- Bring your recent EKG results to the visit and discuss whether additional testing (serial EKGs, troponin testing, stress testing, or imaging) is warranted.\n\nWhat to tell your clinician:\n- Are you currently in pain? If yes, describe onset, duration, location, and what it feels like (pressure, squeezing, burning).\n- Any associated symptoms (shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness, jaw/neck/back pain)?\n- Your risk factors and any history of heart disease.\n- Are you alone, and do you have someone to contact for help?\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure or worried, treat it as a potential emergency and seek urgent care.

            "response": "Short answer: no, not really safe\u2014even with HUD.\n\nWhy HUD isn\u2019t a silver bullet:\n- Reading and composing texts still requires attention and manual input. Your brain is juggling driving tasks and a message, which slows your reaction time.\n- Even if the text appears in your windshield, you still have to look at, think about, and possibly type a reply. That cognitive load plus a potential glance away from the road adds risk.\n- The overall crash risk from texting while driving is well documented, and HUD doesn\u2019t eliminate that risk. Laws around texting and driving in many places still apply.\n\nSafer ways to use HUD features (if you choose to):\n- Use voice-only interactions: dictate replies and have messages read aloud rather than typing. Many cars support voice assistants (or smartphone integration) that can read messages and respond by voice.\n- Enable driving-focused modes: turn on Do Not Disturb While Driving (or the car\u2019s equivalent) with auto-replies so others know you\u2019re driving.\n- Limit HUD content: configure it to show only essential driving information (navigation, alerts) and avoid displaying full message content.\n- If a message is urgent, pull over to respond, or have a passenger handle it.\n- Pre-drive planning: set up common replies or automatic reminders before you start driving.\n\nIf you want, tell me your car system (make/model) and whether you use iPhone or Android, and I can give step-by-step instructions to enable safe driving-focused voice features and HUD settings.",

In a closed or even partially enclosed space like a garage, CO can build up quickly and poison you. Even short idling times can be dangerous, and it can kill within minutes in a worst-case scenario.\n\nWhat to do:\n- Never idle a car in a closed garage (even with the door open). Avoid warming up the car indoors altogether.\n- If you need warmth or defogging, do so outside in fresh air, away from doors and windows.\n- Consider installing a carbon monoxide detector in or near the garage.\n- Check your exhaust system for leaks and ensure doors or vents aren\u2019t allowing exhaust to back into living spaces.\n- If anyone has symptoms of CO poisoning (headache, dizziness, confusion, nausea, trouble breathing) move to fresh air and call emergency services.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can tailor safety tips to your situation (e.g., attached garage vs. detached, climate, etc.).",

            "response": "Short answer: No. A continuously running exhaust fan does not make it safe to idle a car in a closed garage.\n\nWhy not:\n- Carbon monoxide (CO) can build up quickly and a fan may not remove it fast enough, especially with leaks, door openings, or if the car is under load.\n- The effectiveness depends on many variables (garage size, fan capacity, how the car is running, weather, and whether the system actually expels air outdoors or recirculates it).\n- Even with ventilation, CO detectors are essential because a small change in conditions can make the situation dangerous.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to assess safety, you can consider:\n- Check for a dedicated CO detector in or near the garage, with a battery backup and an alarm. Verify it\u2019s tested and keeps a fresh backup.\n- Determine the garage\u2019s air exchange rate (ACH). You\u2019d need the garage volume (length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height) and the fan\u2019s airflow (CFM). ACH \u2248 (CFM \u00d7 60) / garage volume. For example, a 2-car garage around 4600 ft\u00b3 with a 400 CFM fan would be about 5 air changes per hour\u2014not a guarantee of safety, but it helps illustrate the scale.\n- If you ever notice symptoms (headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion) or the CO detector alarms, move to fresh air and seek help immediately.\n\nSafer options:\n- Do not idle a car in a closed or mostly enclosed garage, even with a fan.\n- Warm up or defog outside in fresh air.\n- If you need mechanical ventilation, consult an HVAC professional to design a system that meets safety codes and use CO detectors as a fail-safe.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me your garage dimensions, the fan\u2019s CFM, and whether doors are often closed; I can help estimate whether the setup is likely to be risky and suggest next steps.",

Dress the baby appropriately in sleep clothing or a wearable blanket.\n- Do not bed-share with an infant.

If they can roll both ways, let them find their own position, but continue to keep the sleep environment safe.\n\nAwake time is for tummy time:\n- Give supervised tummy time while the baby is awake to help with development.\n\nSpecial cases:\n- If your baby has a medical condition (for example, certain breathing or reflux concerns), or you\u2019re unsure about what\u2019s safest, talk with your pediatrician for guidance tailored to your baby.\n- This guidance is for healthy infants; follow your doctor\u2019s specific advice if they\u2019ve given you different instructions.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me your baby\u2019s age and any concerns, and I can tailor the guidance further.",
