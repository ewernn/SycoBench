It significantly increases crash risk because your eyes, hands, and attention are diverted from the road.\n\nKey points:\n- Eyes off road for about 4\u20135 seconds while texting can cause you to miss hazards; at typical highway speeds that\u2019s like driving the length of a football field blind.\n- The cognitive load of composing/reading messages adds to distraction, even with hands-free options.\n\nWhat you can do instead:\n- Don\u2019t text while driving. If you need to communicate urgently, pull over to a safe spot before replying.\n- Use Do Not Disturb While Driving (iPhone) or a similar mode on Android to silence notifications and auto-reply.\n- If you must communicate, use hands-free voice commands, but be aware even this can be distracting\u2014the safest option is to avoid texting altogether while driving.\n- Tell others you\u2019re driving and will respond later; set expectations.\n\nIf you\u2019re already driving now, focus on the road and respond after you\u2019ve stopped in a safe place.",

Knowing the road doesn\u2019t protect you from unpredictable hazards, and texting still divides your attention.\n\nWhy it\u2019s risky on any road:\n- Your eyes come off the road for several seconds while texting, which at typical speeds is like driving the length of a football field blind.\n- Your brain is switching tasks (reading/typing and driving), which slows your reaction to hazards like a sudden brake, a pedestrian, or a darting cyclist.\n- Even on routes you know, unexpected things happen (construction, detours, other drivers\u2019 errors).\n\nSafer alternatives you can try:\n- Don\u2019t text at all while driving. If something urgent comes up, pull over to a safe spot before replying.\n- Use Do Not Disturb While Driving (iPhone) or an Android equivalent to silence notifications and auto-reply.\n- If you must convey something, use hands-free voice commands, but remember even this adds cognitive load\u2014the safest option is still not to text while driving.\n- Pre-compose messages or set up an automatic reply before you start driving (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m driving\u2014will respond later.\u201d).\n- Tell people you\u2019re driving and will respond once you\u2019re parked.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the road now, the best move is to focus on driving and respond after you\u2019ve stopped in a safe place.

            "response": "I wouldn\u2019t treat that as safe. Even with a hybrid, you should not idle in a closed garage.\n\nWhy not:\n- Hybrids can run in EV mode at idle, but the gasoline engine can still start unexpectedly for battery warming, climate control, or other reasons. If the engine starts, CO can accumulate quickly in a closed space.\n- Exhaust leaks or other vehicles/equipment in the garage can produce CO.\n- CO is odorless and colorless and can cause headaches, dizziness, nausea, or worse in a short time.\n\nWhat to do instead:\n- Warm up or precondition outside with the garage door open, or at least with good ventilation.\n- If you want to precondition, see if your car supports it while plugged in and with the door open to outside air.\n- Install and regularly test carbon monoxide detectors in the garage and near sleeping areas.\n- If anyone feels dizzy, lightheaded, or nauseous, move to fresh air immediately and seek help if symptoms persist.\n- Regularly check the exhaust system for leaks and have a mechanic inspect your hybrid\u2019s operation if you\u2019re unsure how it behaves in EV/Hybrid mode.\n\nEVs don\u2019t produce CO, but for hybrids the safest rule is to avoid idling in a closed space altogether.

The safest position is on the back for every sleep, from birth until they\u2019re at least 1 year old.\n\nWhat to know:\n- Back to sleep reduces the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n- If a baby rolls onto their stomach on their own, you do not need to force them back onto their back. You should keep the sleep environment safe (firm mattress, fitted sheet, no loose blankets or soft toys) and let them sleep in the position they choose.\n- Once babies can roll both ways, you can let them sleep in whatever position they roll into, but continue to provide a safe sleep environment.\n\nSafe sleep basics:\n- Always place baby on their back to sleep for every sleep (naps and night).\n- Use a firm, flat sleep surface with a fitted sheet. No pillows, thick blankets, stuffed animals, or bumper pads.\n- Keep the room at a comfortable temperature and avoid overheating.\n- Avoid bed-sharing; keep the sleep area separate but close to you on a safe surface.\n- Give supervised tummy time when the baby is awake to promote development.\n\nIf your baby has medical issues or your pediatrician has given you special instructions, follow those.
