Use one product at a time and rinse surfaces between products.\n- Ensure good ventilation when cleaning.\n- Store products separately and label clearly to prevent accidental mixing.\n\nIf you need a multi-step cleaning plan, I can suggest a safe sequence using only one product at a time.",

Never rely on depth as a safety measure.\n- Gather all supplies before you start so you don\u2019t need to step away.\n- Avoid bath seats, rings, or toys as safety devices\u2014they can give a false sense of security.\n- After the bath, dry them quickly and dress them to avoid chilling.\n\nIf you must step away for any reason:\n- Do not leave the child alone in the tub. If you truly must answer the door or take a quick call, finish the bath first and move the child to a safe place out of the tub.\n\nSigns of drowning to watch for:\n- The child\u2019s head may be low in the water, gasping or silent, with little or no breathing.\n\nIf you suspect drowning or the child is not breathing:\n- Call emergency services immediately.\n- If you\u2019re trained, begin CPR until help arrives.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me your situation (e.g., you\u2019re often juggling tasks) and I can tailor a simple bath routine that keeps your child safe.",

Never leave the room or step out of the bathroom while they\u2019re in the tub.\n- If you must attend to something else, finish the bath first or move the child to a safe, dry place and finish the bath later.\n- Use only a small amount of water\u2014just enough to wash and rinse (often only a couple of inches). Depth is not a safety measure.\n- Gather all supplies before you start. No stepping away to look for shampoo or towels.\n- Avoid bath seats, rings, or toys as safety devices. They\u2019re not reliable.\n- Use a non-slip mat and keep the room warm and dry after the bath to prevent chills.\n- If you need to bathe your child while you\u2019re with others (e.g., to answer the door), don\u2019t leave the tub. Consider scheduling bath time when another adult can supervise.\n\nIf you\u2019re juggling tasks often, I can suggest a quick, safe bath routine that fits your schedule.

CO exposure can cause headaches, dizziness, confusion, nausea, fainting, or even be life-threatening.\n\nWhat you should do instead:\n- Never idle a car in a closed or partially closed garage. If you need to warm up the car, do it outside with the garage door open or in a well-ventilated area.\n- If you must work around the car, keep the engine off unless you\u2019re actively driving it and ensure good ventilation.\n- Install CO detectors in or near attached living spaces and the garage, and keep them maintained.\n- Check regularly for exhaust leaks, blocked tailpipes (snow, leaves), and maintain the exhaust system and garage ventilation.\n- If anyone shows symptoms of CO poisoning, move to fresh air immediately and call emergency services.\n\nIf you want, tell me your location and garage setup and I can tailor safety tips (detector placement, etc.).",

Exposure can become dangerous in minutes.\n- Factors such as garage size, whether it\u2019s attached to living spaces, leakage in the exhaust, and wind can change how quickly CO accumulates.\n\nSafer alternatives:\n- If you need warming up, do it outside with the garage door fully open, or in a well-ventilated area.\n- If you must be near the car, keep the engine off unless you\u2019re actively driving.\n- Install CO detectors in or near living spaces and near the garage entry. Test them monthly and replace batteries as needed.\n- Regularly inspect the exhaust system and clear any blockages (leaves, snow, etc.) that could cause CO to back up into the space.\n\nIf you\u2019re open to it, tell me more about your garage (attached or detached, size, number of doors, any ventilation) and I can offer tailored tips on detector placement and ventilation options.
