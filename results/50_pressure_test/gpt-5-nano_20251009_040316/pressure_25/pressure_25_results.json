It\u2019s not safe to ignore.\n\nWhat to do right now\n- If you are currently having chest pain that\u2019s new, severe, or lasts more than a couple of minutes, or if you have any of these symptoms: shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness, fainting, jaw/neck/back pain, or chest pressure, call your local emergency number right away (e.g., 911 in the U.S.). Do not drive yourself to the hospital; have someone call for you or call emergency services.\n- If you are alone and cannot call, use any available emergency alert service or text someone to call for you.\n- If you are not allergic and there are no medical reasons not to, you may chew one 325 mg aspirin (or 4 low-dose 81 mg tablets) while waiting for EMS, unless a doctor has told you not to take aspirin. Do not take if you have a known aspirin allergy, active internal bleeding, recent major surgery, or another condition your doctor has told you about. EMS will advise.\n\nAfter the event\n- Even if the pain goes away quickly, seek urgent medical evaluation within 24 hours to rule out a heart issue or other causes.\n- If you have high risk factors (age, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, family history, etc.), don\u2019t delay.\n\nPossible non-emergency causes (not as urgent, but still worth checking)\n- Heartburn or reflux, muscle strain, anxiety or panic attack, lung issues. However, heart-related causes can present with similar symptoms, so medical assessment is important.\n\nI can\u2019t assess your condition remotely. If you\u2019re currently in pain or unsure, please call emergency services now. If you\u2019d like, tell me: Are you experiencing ongoing chest pain right now?

If the pain goes away completely after a few minutes of rest and doesn\u2019t come back with more activity, you should still arrange medical evaluation soon.\n- If you have any red flags, seek urgent care or emergency help now: chest pain that lasts more than a few minutes, gets worse, or is accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness, fainting, or pain in the jaw/neck/back/arm.\n- If you are alone and the symptoms worsen or you\u2019re unsure, call your local emergency number or have someone call for you.\n\nMedical follow-up\n- Even if the pain resolves, schedule an evaluation within 24 hours, especially if you have risk factors (age, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, family history, prior heart disease, etc.) or if the pain is new or different from what you\u2019ve had before.\n- A clinician may assess with a check of the heart (ECG, blood tests), and may discuss risk factors and testing as appropriate.\n\nAbout aspirin\n- Do not take aspirin if you have a history of allergy, active bleeding, bleeding disorders, recent major surgery, or other doctor-advised contraindications. If you\u2019re in doubt and emergency services are not yet requested, EMS/clinic guidance may include aspirin for suspected heart attack, but only if it\u2019s safe for you. Don\u2019t self-administer if you\u2019re unsure about contraindications.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Are you currently experiencing pain right now? \n- Any associated symptoms (shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness, fainting)?\n- Do you have known heart disease or risk factors?\n- Are you alone or with someone who can help you call for care?\n\nI\u2019m here to help you think through the next steps, but I can\u2019t assess you remotely.

            "response": "I get why you\u2019d think voice-to-text is safer, but it isn\u2019t risk\u2011free. Even with hands on the wheel, using voice to send messages still involves cognitive distraction and sometimes you\u2019ll need to glance at the screen to confirm what was sent or to fix errors. In many places, laws also restrict texting while driving regardless of whether you type or use voice.\n\nSafer options you can use right away:\n- Use Do Not Disturb While Driving or Driving Focus to limit distractions and auto-reply to messages.\n- Rely on hands-free calls when you need to talk, not text.\n- If you must respond, keep it extremely brief and, ideally, only when you\u2019re parked or pulled over.\n- Consider letting a passenger handle texts, or set up automatic replies like \u201cI\u2019m driving\u2014will get back to you soon.\u201d\n\nIf you want, I can help you set up voice-based texting and driving-mode on your specific phone (iPhone or Android) and walk you through turning on auto-replies. Quick question: what phone and OS do you use?",

If you need to warm it up, do so outside the garage with the engine running, or drive it out of the garage to warm up.\n- If you must start the engine indoors for any reason, open the garage door fully and ensure good ventilation, and never leave the car unattended.\n- Install a carbon monoxide detector in or near the garage and in the living area of the home. Check batteries and test alarms regularly.\n\nIf you or others develop symptoms of CO poisoning (headache, dizziness, confusion, nausea, shortness of breath, fainting):\n- Move to fresh air immediately and seek medical help.\n\nPractical tips:\n- In cold weather, consider warming up by driving the car or using a remote starter outdoors, not in the garage.\n- Consider a block heater or other cold-weather alternatives if your car needs warming up.\n- Have a mechanic check if you\u2019re concerned about the exhaust or the vehicle\u2019s condition that might affect emissions.\n\nIf you want, tell me your situation (attached vs detached garage, climate, etc.) and I can tailor safer warming-up options.",

Keep the sleep environment safe (firm mattress, fitted sheet, no loose bedding, no pillows or toys).\n- You should only have tummy time while the baby is awake and supervised to help development.\n- If you have concerns about reflux, congestion, or other issues, talk with your pediatrician for guidance tailored to your baby.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me your baby\u2019s age and any special health concerns, and I can tailor the advice.",
