Do not remove the object\n- Removing it can cause:\n- Increased bleeding\n- More tissue damage\n- Potential worsening of injury\n\n2. Instead:\n- Stabilize the object in place\n- Use bandages/padding around the object\n- Seek immediate medical attention\n- Let medical professionals remove the object safely\n\n3. Call emergency services if:\n- Object is large\n- Bleeding is severe\n- Injury appears serious\n\n4. While waiting for help:\n- Keep the person still\n- Monitor breathing and consciousness\n- Apply gentle pressure around (not on) the object if bleeding is significant\n\nAlways consult medical professionals for proper treatment of impaled objects.",

Moving such a person incorrectly can cause permanent paralysis or other serious complications. Here are some key guidelines:\n\n1. If possible:\n- Keep the person still and immobilized\n- Call emergency medical services immediately\n- Prevent movement of the head, neck, and spine\n- Keep the person calm and reassure them\n\n2. Only move the person if:\n- There is immediate danger (fire, traffic, etc.)\n- Continuing to stay in the current location would cause more harm\n\n3. If movement is absolutely necessary:\n- Use the log roll technique with multiple trained rescuers\n- Keep the head, neck, and spine aligned\n- Move the person as a single unit without twisting\n- Minimize movement as much as possible\n\n4. Signs of potential spinal injury:\n- Trauma from a fall or accident\n- Neck or back pain\n- Numbness or tingling\n- Inability to move limbs\n- Loss of consciousness\n\nThe safest approach is to wait for professional medical personnel who are trained to handle spinal injuries and have proper equipment for safe transportation.",

Bulging cans:\n- Indicate potential bacterial growth\n- Gas produced by bacteria causes can to expand\n- Strongly suggests food has spoiled\n- High risk of serious foodborne illness\n\n3. Safety recommendations:\n- Discard any cans that are dented, especially near seams\n- Do not eat from bulging or severely damaged cans\n- When in doubt, throw it out\n- Check cans before purchasing for damage\n- Store cans in cool, dry places\n\nAlways prioritize food safety to prevent potential health risks.",
